        <p>Many people who are unfamiliar with autism associate it with a character they saw from a movie, like “Rain Man”. They think autistic people have some peculiar and unexplainable behavior, and yet they possess savant skills enabling them to count fallen toothpicks almost instantaneously.  Autism is a developmental disorder affecting on the average one out of 68 children in the United States. This data was gathered and reported by The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network which is funded by Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They sampled 11 communities within the United States and average out the findings. It’s important to note that in South Carolina it was reported that 1 in 81 children were diagnosed with autism, while in New Jersey 1 in 41 children were diagnosed with autism.  With autism on the rise, it is now being called by some an epidemic. Autism is not an illness; it’s a spectrum and therefore affects each individual differently, but one thing autistic individuals have in common is that autism affects their communication and impedes on their social interaction. Some children are born autistic, others may develop autism when they are between the ages of one and three, but some develop it even as late as six years of age. Parents notice signs of fleeting or no eye contact, loss of language and communication abilities, perseverating on certain tasks and other unexplainable behavior, and no, most of them do not have savant skills. After undergoing a battery of test and not finding any physical abnormalities, the diagnosis is autism. It almost seems like the child lost the ability to learn, or some say it’s as if there is a missing piece of a puzzle. No matter how it’s explained, it’s obvious that the person with autism is no average Joe.</p>

        <p>Years ago the medical community felt that autism could not be treated and “nothing can be done” along with some’s belief that the cause of autism was due to the “refrigerator mother” – someone cold and unaffectionate to the child.  Although it is now known that autism is not caused by lack of maternal affection, it is still unclear of just what causes autism. While there is still no medication to treat autism, it is now known that autistic individuals can learn and make progress. The learning is a parallel process; while a child learns new skills, the parents learn to read the cues and how to handle some difficult situations. Due to many factors, oftentimes the individual with autism may become overwhelmed in a situation or may be experiencing discomfort  or may just be  feeling thirsty and not being able to communicate their needs; this can causes a great deal of frustration and lead to screaming and crying, referred to as a “meltdown”.  Once the skill of communication is taught and reinforced, the communication replaces many of these meltdowns. The important thing to understand is that they can learn, and achieve; they just learn in a different way. Many mildly autistic individuals are classified as Asperger’s, and excel in sciences and math and become valuable members in the science community.  In a recent “Conversations with Tyler” at Mercatus Center, George Mason University, Peter Thiel said: <i>"In Silicon Valley, I point out that many of the more successful entrepreneurs seem to be suffering from a mild form of Asperger's where it's like you're missing the imitation, socialization gene." Asperger's "happens to be a plus for innovation and creating great companies,"</i> he added.</p>

        <p>At a young age a child with autism can be helped by therapy that teaches the child valuable skills which serve as foundation to future building blocks. Without proper therapy, the child may go through life never learning not only how to read and write, but more importantly not learning how to communicate. What will become of these children when they become adults? They will have to rely on someone for the rest of their lives to care for them. However, with the right approach and appropriate therapy, these children can learn many necessary skills. They are not necessarily missing a piece of a puzzle, it’s more like the piece of the puzzle has not been turned over yet and therefore was not placed in its designated space. If we believe the math explanation that “The Whole Equals the Sum of its Parts”, then it should follow that a person as a whole is the sum of his/her skills. This is why learning necessary skills as early as possible and in a proper environment and with proper support, for individuals with autism can lead to learning enough skills to achieve independence, become active participants in the society, and be held in high regard as valuable members of the job force.  </p>

        <h1 id="gotohow">How To Help</h1>
        <p>It’s not surprising that people “shy away” from individuals with autism; for one thing, how do you talk to someone who may just want to talk about one subject and it’s a subject only they are interested in?  There is only so much you want to hear about all the highways in the United States or the type of pens they have. They probably will not want to play games that require social interaction and could just walk away while you attempt to engage them in a conversation. Many schools now offer inclusion and classes where children with Autism are a part of mainstream education. But what about outside of school; what are the ways that someone can be of help? It could be in a form of not staring or making comments when a child is exhibiting odd behavior or when eating at a restaurant, or at a grocery store, or letting them go in front of the line at an amusement park or public bathroom. Including these individuals in activities, even if they can’t do it like everyone else, is a big help – they still get the benefit of participating. Teaching typically developing children acceptance and understanding is a big help, but inviting the child to a birthday party or setting up a play date is a huge help. Hollywood has now produced a few shows and movies with autistic main characters in attempt to show their abilities and yet inabilities or difficulties with skills that most of us take for granted, like greeting someone when they greet you. Who knows-the autistic child may grow up to be the next Einstein.  </p>
