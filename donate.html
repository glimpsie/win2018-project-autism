    <p>While there are many organizations that can receive monetary donations,  there are other ways to donate. Donation does not only need to be in terms of money. Time is a way to help a family, setting a play date, including an individual with autism into activities or sending a birthday or a holiday card â€“ there are so many other simple acts of kindness. Asking the government to conduct a current count of individuals with Autism in all the states would give a clearer picture of number of individuals per state and writing to your elected officials, asking to increase funding for research is another type of donation. </p>
