       <p>We are concerned individuals that care about the autistic population. Unfortunately, there are many people, some perhaps with good intentions, others with experimental goals in mind and yet another group who look to profit from those looking for answers and are charged hefty sums of money for no benefit in return. Itâ€™s a good idea to check if the recommended approach has been successful for others and ask questions to get a better idea of what the situation was like before and after, and was that the only intervention that took place. Not only the individuals with autism can be taken advantage of, but their families as well, desperately looking for ways to help their loved one.  </p>
